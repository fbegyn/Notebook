# Frag-o-matic: correct influxdb

All queries below are designed for Influxdb 2.0 .

## Switch opendns to cloudflare

For some editions I mistakenly labeled the Cloudflare endpoint as opendns (woopsie_). This is a flux
query that will fix the entries in the database.

```
from(bucket: "joki/autogen")
  |> range(start: 2000-01-01T00:00:01Z, stop: -5m)
  |> filter(fn: (r) => r._measurement == "joki" 
     and (r.target_host == "1.1.1.1"))
  |> set(key: "target_name", value: "cloudflare")

renameCloudflare 
  |> to(bucket: "joki/autogen")
```
