# Write down your work

Advertise your work. People tend to forget to write down reports of your work and what the impact of
it was. And then they forget to advertise the usefullnes of you work.

So, write down your work and let it be known what you have done. Beeing the smartest person in the
room is not useful if nobody knows what you are doing.
