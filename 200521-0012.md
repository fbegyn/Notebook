title: What is an ssh agent?
:tech:ssh:agent:

It is used to keep ssh keys in memory, but they keep it there unencrypted ready to use. this is still
somewhat secure since the ssh-agent does not write the key to memory or can be exported from the
memory location.

Contrary to initial believes, these keys do not encrypt/decrypt traffic. they are only used to
validate and sign the incoming traffic to see if the traffic is validated.

The exchanged keys to validate these messages can be `rekeyed` multiple times over the course of a
session

constrained keys are keys with limited lifetimes or that the user has explicitley needed to accept.

An ssh socket can have multiple channels. These are used for example when making use of ssh-agent
forwarding or proxying through hosts.
