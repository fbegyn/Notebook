title: Zettelkasten seems awesome

Zettelkasten seems to handle all the problems that I have with other note taking
applications, mainly that they suck because they are linear set in stone kind of style.
Once a note has been made there is no way to later rearrange it and take care of it. Lets see how
this works and if I can manage to keep it alive long enough to reap the benefits of it.
