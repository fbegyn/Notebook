# Nixos packages

## Global configuration

Global configuration for the nixos packages can be set in the `configuration.nix`. The global
configuration is seperate from a users configuration in `~/.config/nixpkgs/config.nix`.

Packages can be overwritten by calling the function `packageOverrides`. It takes pkgs as an
arguemnt and returns a set of modified packages.

## overlays

Overlays modify the the nixpkgs layers by adding fixed-points to them. Nixpkgs can be configured
with a list ofoverlays, which are applied in order.

Overlays are function with 2 arguements: `self` and `super` and return a set of packages. For
examples:

```
self: super:

{
  boost = super.boost.override {
    python = self.python3;
  };
  rr = super.callPackage ./pkgs/rr {
    stdenv = self.stdenv_32bit;
  };
}
```

`self` cmatches the final package set. Used for dependencies of all packages in the overlay.

`super` matches the results of the previous Nixpkgs stages. It does not contain anything from the
current or following layers. Used for package override or access function in nixpkgs.

## Overriding

Modify parts of an existing nixpkgs.

* `<pkgs>.override{ k = v; k = v; ... }`: Override the package set with the key specified.
* `<pkgs>.overrideAttribute`: override the attributes set in the packages
* `<pkgs>.overrideDerivation`: prefered to use overrideAttribute. Creates a new derivation based on
  the original attributes

## The standard environment

Provide a standard environment to build packages in.

By using `stdenv.mkDerivation{}` we can create a derivation with the standard environment.
Dependencies of the package can be specified in the `buildInputs = []` section.

Each "phase" of a package (building, installing, ...) can be overwritten from the standard with
`installPhase`, `buildPhase`, ...

A build script can be passed to the `builder` section ( `builder = <script.sh>` ).
